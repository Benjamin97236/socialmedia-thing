This is a free, open project I have built just for fun.
The backend is mostly object oriented PHP, frontend is HTML, CSS, Javascript(Vanilla, Ajax, JQuery).

OBS (You may notice some parts being written in Swedish)

Feel free to contribute to, copy or read the code!
Make sure to run it on a local server such as xampp 
the .sql file is "blog.sql" and make sure to import it to your database before using the application!

I have also tried documenting as much as possible, this is a work in progress project still :)
